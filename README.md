# Laptop-Price-Dataset
Machine Learning Model


Data Collection

1. Gather laptop specifications and price data from various sources (e.g., websites, datasets)
2. Collect features such as:
    - Processor (categorical)
    - Processor Speed (numerical)
    - RAM (numerical)
    - Storage (numerical)
    - Graphics Card (categorical)
    - Operating System (categorical)
3. Collect target variable: Price (numerical)

Data Preprocessing

1. Clean and handle missing values
2. Encode categorical variables (e.g., Processor, Graphics Card, Operating System)
3. Scale/normalize numerical features (e.g., Processor Speed, RAM, Storage)
4. Split data into training (80%) and testing sets (20%)

Model Training

1. Train a Random Forest Regressor model on the training data
2. Tune hyperparameters:
    - Number of Estimators
    - Max Depth
    - Min Samples Split
    - Min Samples Leaf
3. Evaluate model performance on the testing data using:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - R-Squared

Model Deployment

1. Create a RESTful API to allow users to input laptop specifications and receive predicted prices
2. Build a web application to visualize the model's predictions and allow user interaction
